# Materials Tracker

Welcome! This is a Work-In-Progress Materials Tracker Application. It is being built to serve the purpose of allowing a logged-in user to make deposits of different material types and have them sorted, weighed, and stored to track how much an orginization has taken in. The idea originated as a way to help a Nonprofit display how much waste they had saved from being thrown away, and it also works pretty effectively as an essential inventory management system.

## Basic use cases

1. As a user of the system, I need to be able to register myself with a username and password.
2. As a user of the system, I need to be able to log in using my registered username and password.
3. As a user, when I register a new account is created for me.
4. As an authenticated user of the system, I need to be able to see my Account Details.
5. As an authenticated user of the system, I need to be able to create a deposit of any amount and type of materials (Different types of wood, glass, hardware...).
   1. I should be able to choose from a list of material types.
   2. Empty deposits should not be allowed.
   3. A deposit should include the User ID of the user making the deposit.
   4. The desposit form should automatically fill in the User ID.
   5. A deposit should require the "From" input.  
6. Current total weight saved should be displayed on front page
      a. Would like to be able to choose between displaying total weight and weight by material type
